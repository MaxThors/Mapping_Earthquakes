# Mapping Earthquakes and Fault Lines

## Overview of Project
The overall purpose of this project was to use a Mapbox API and Leaflet to map earthquakes in the past 7 days and the fault lines. We also
added different styles of maps and added some filters along with a legend. 

## Results
We were able to map all of the eartquakes within the past 7 days throughout the world. The size and color of the circle markers were 
indicators of the magnitude of the earthquake. This is a way to better visualize the data. 

## Summary

While this map is helpful, there are more ways we can improve the maps. First, we can add more styles of maps to make it more visually
appealing. Then, we could do more analysis on the earthquakes and see which parts of the world had higher magnitudes.
